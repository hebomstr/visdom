# Visdom | Proof of Concept & User Guide

This is the proof of concept application of our project work. It's purpose is only to demonstrate the functionality of our visualizations and designs in a real web page. Quality and scalability of the code was not a requirement. All libraries that have been used are under MIT license. The app is a school course application which shows visualizations we have designed for students.
